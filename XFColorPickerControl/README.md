# XFColorPickerControl

### Color Picker Control for Xamarin.Forms!

Watch me build a Color Picker UI Control for Xamarin.Forms using SkiaSharp...

The special implementation of this Control in a gist:

- Modeled after the Ms Paint Color picker
- Populate a full spectrum of colors on a canvas
- Add the darkened gradient colors spectrum on it
- Enable touch responses on the canvas
- Intercept the touch point cordinates detection
- Paint the touch point on the canvas for feedback
- Read the pixels off of the touch point cordinates
- Extract out the dominant color of that pixel point
- Return the Color object back to Xamarin.Forms

Still WIP though, stay in touch! ;)
